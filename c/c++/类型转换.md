#### static_cast & reinterpret_cast
>static_casting a pointer to and from void* preserves the address. That is, in the following, a, b and c all point to the same address:<\br>
>int* a = new int();<\br>
>void* b = static_cast<void*>(a);<\br>
>int* c = static_cast<int*>(b);<\br>

>reinterpret_cast only guarantees that if you cast a pointer to a different type, and then reinterpret_cast it back to the original type, you get the original value. So in the following:<\br>
>int* a = new int();<\br>
>void* b = reinterpret_cast<void*>(a);<\br>
>int* c = reinterpret_cast<int*>(b);<\br>
>a and c contain the same value, but the value of b is unspecified. (in practice it will typically contain the same address as a and c, but that's not specified in the standard, and it may not be true on machines with more complex memory systems.)<\br>
